My requirements:
- Every file should have a short description
- Every folder should have a short description, can run semantic search on that (This is unrelated to the user)
- Based on this, now for the user for every commit create a description of the users changes in that commit only count that commit if that is by the user.
- Every branch should also have a story/descirption of what its doing
- First class support to support multiple branches, to be able to list different branches, we should be intelligently only read the main branch and only read the commits in the side branch 
- Make all of this searchable using search command in cli, search can also be limited by the project, folder/file 
- Using this allow user to write a worklog for given nummber of days 1, 3, 7 etc
- We can gather all of the data above and make that story.
- Ditch the graph db but semantic search should work, keep the setup for it we will use it later
- Lets have a standard format for worklog, worklog should also make an md file with the worklog in the .worklog directory, this can be produced by LLM.
