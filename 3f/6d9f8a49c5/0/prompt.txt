Implement the following plan:

# DevLog Product Video — Remotion Implementation Plan

## Context

DevLog needs a 35-second product video for marketing. The video demonstrates the problem (forgetting what you shipped across repos) and the solution (DevLog CLI). No voiceover — sound design + on-screen text only. Dark, minimal, slightly edgy tone. Built with Remotion (React-based programmatic video) in a new `video/` directory.

## Video Specs
- **Duration:** 35 seconds (1050 frames at 30fps)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080
- **Format:** H.264 MP4
- **Design:** Matches existing DevLog brand — `#00ff41` green accent, `#0a0a0a` dark bg, JetBrains Mono + Space Grotesk fonts

## Scene Breakdown & Timing

### Scene 1 — Slack (150 frames, 0-5s)
- Frames 0-20: Black → Slack UI fade-in (opacity interpolate + scale 0.97→1.0)
- Frame 5: Slack notification sound
- Frames 10-150: Ambient hum fades in
- Frames 25-70: Manager message typewriters in: *"Performance review today. Let's go through what you've been doing for the last 3 months."*
- Frames 70-120: Typing indicator blinks (no reply)
- Frames 100-145: Slow zoom into message (scale 1.0→1.08)
- Frames 145-150: Hard cut to black

### Scene 2 — Chaos (240 frames, 5-13s)
- Frames 0-10: Black
- Frames 10-75: Stats flash one at a time with hard cuts:
  - "12,000 lines of code." → "5 repositories." → "12 branches." → "3 teams."
- Frames 75-140: Rapid montage — git log scrolling, overlapping branch names, PR notifications, stacked terminals. Flash text: "Context switches." "Standups." "Hotfixes."
- Frames 140-145: Hard cut to silence + black
- Frames 155-235: "Stop scrolling through git logs." fades in, holds 2 seconds, fades out

### Scene 3 — DevLog (330 frames, 13-24s)
- Frames 0-25: Terminal window fades in (spring smooth)
- Frames 25-55: Typewriter: `$ npm install -g @ishaan812/devlog`
- Frames 65-85: Typewriter: `$ devlog onboard`
- Frames 95-145: Typewriter: `$ devlog ingest` commands + rapid sub-lines
- Frames 145-175: Green output: "Ingested 2,847 commits..."
- Frames 185-220: Typewriter: `$ devlog worklog --days 90`
- Frames 230-330: Markdown summary slides in from right — structured work log with headers and bullets

### Scene 4 — Reversal (210 frames, 24-31s)
- Frames 0-5: Instant cut to Slack UI
- Frames 15-90: Reply typewriters in: *"Over the last 3 months I shipped payments, implemented authentication, fixed production bugs, and improved API performance."*
- Frame 90-100: Message sends (whoosh sound)
- Frames 140-160: Manager replies with thumbs up
- Frames 160-210: Hold on messages, silence

### Scene 5 — Final (120 frames, 31-35s)
- Frames 10-50: "You ship across too many repos." fades in/out
- Frames 45-80: "Stop forgetting what you shipped." fades in/out
- Frames 75-95: "DevLog" pops in large, green (#00ff41), snappy spring
- Frames 85-100: "Open-source. Local-first." appears below
- Frames 95-115: Cursor blinks
- Frames 115-120: Everything fades to black

## Audio Strategy

All sounds sourced from **Pixabay Sound Effects** (royalty-free, no attribution required).

| File | Description | Used In |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `slack-notification.mp3` | Short notification knock | Scene 1 |
| `ambient-hum.mp3` | Low office/computer hum (~10s loop) | Scene 1-2 |
| `typing-fast.mp3` | Aggressive rapid typing | Scene 2 |
| `typing-soft.mp3` | Gentle keyboard typing | Scene 3-4 |
| `notification-stack.mp3` | Multiple overlapping notifications | Scene 2 |
| `send-message.mp3` | Short whoosh for message send | Scene 4 |

Audio managed by a single `AudioLayer.tsx` component using `<Sequence>` + `<Audio>` with frame-based `volume` callbacks for fade-in/out. Scene 5 is silent.

---

## Design System

Reuse existing DevLog brand from `frontend/src/index.css`:
- **Colors:** `#0a0a0a` bg, `#00ff41` green accent, `#e0e0e0` text, `#888888` secondary
- **Fonts:** JetBrains Mono (terminal/code), Space Grotesk (display/headings) via `@remotion/google-fonts`
- **Slack colors:** `#1a1d21` bg, `#19171d` sidebar, `#d1d2d3` text
- **Terminal:** `#0d1117` body, `#21262d` header, traffic light dots

---

## Key Technical Patterns

- **All animations frame-based** — `useCurrentFrame()` + `interpolate()` / `spring()`, never CSS transitions
- **Typewriter** — string slicing via `useTypewriter` hook, not per-character opacity
- **Scene arrangement** — `TransitionSeries` with no transitions between sequences = hard cuts
- **Spring presets:** `{ damping: 200 }` smooth, `{ damping: 20, stiffness: 200 }` snappy
- **Assets** — `staticFile()` for all audio in `public/sounds/`

---

## Dependencies

```
remotion, @remotion/cli, @remotion/transitions, @remotion/google-fonts, @remotion/media
react, react-dom, typescript
```

All `@remotion/*` packages pinned to the **exact same version**.

---

## Implementation Order

1. **Scaffold** — `npx create-video@latest --blank video`, install deps
2. **Design system** — `colors.ts`, `fonts.ts`, `useTypewriter.ts` hook
3. **Components** — CursorBlink → TypewriterText → FlashText → Terminal → TerminalLine → SlackUI → SlackMessage → TypingIndicator → GitLogScroll → MarkdownPreview
4. **Scenes** — Scene5Final (simplest) → Scene1Slack → Scene2Chaos → Scene3DevLog (most complex) → Scene4Reversal
5. **Audio** — Download sounds to `public/sounds/`, create AudioLayer.tsx
6. **Integration** — Video.tsx orchestrator, Root.tsx composition, index.ts entry
7. **Polish** — Test in Remotion Studio, tune timing/volumes, render

## Verification

1. `cd video && npx remotion studio` — preview each scene individually
2. Scrub through timeline checking timing of every text element and transition
3. Verify audio sync — notification sounds align with visual events
4. `npx remotion render DevLogProductVideo out/devlog-product-video.mp4` — full render
5. Play final MP4, verify 35s duration, 1080p, smooth playback

## .gitignore additions

Add to root `.gitignore`:
```
video/node_modules/
video/out/
```

First scene show the slack UI a lot more zoomed in, the message by manager in bigger font should be visible clearly also wait some time after the message has come so user can register whats happenign. Second scene, Each text should come together, first text (5 repos) can come in first, then move up then comes second text then that moves up want to show all together at same time (and then a slight pause) Also show the branhces animation and git log scrolling animation here too (Move this ot the bottom of the screen). 4th scene copy paste the entire worklog that we generate in the screen before (Paste the whole thing that we see there), also wait 2 s add a typing manager from the manager and then put the Thumbs Up, and then another message saying "Damn you've been shipping a lot, time for a promotion!" and then you react to that with a celebration emoji. In next scene also liek second scene do the same thing, all text comes one by one and show them all together (Should have multiple things like, "You ship across too many repos, branches, pull requests",

  second scene do the same thing, all text comes one by one and show them all together (Should have multiple things like, "You ship across too many repos, branches, pull requests", its ok if the video timing goes higher feel free ot take it up to 60 s but fit all this in.

---

Scene wait for at least 3 seconds after the managers message comes in. Scene 2 change the order, 3 teams, 5 repos, 15 branches, standups, hotifixes (All of this on same page reduce font of earlier content as new thing keeps on coming maybe, (Remove the ocntext switches part), Instead of stop scrolling through git logs have, "Stop reconstructing your week from memory for every standup" .  In scene 4 also have the zoomed in slackUI like scene 1 pls should be identical, also add a confetti animation after the manager puts the confetti emoji message. Make the last devlog screen be around 5s in total, after the local first line add "by @ishaan812" in next line too. Make the green blinking animation a little bit more interesting.

---

Scene 5 also add a large grey box (npm install -g @ishaan812/devlog ~ in our green) and also we need to add a find out more at devlog.ishaan812.com also soemhere se ewhere this will fit. Scene3 make the worklog more prominent when we generate it and (increase time on this scene by 2 s so user gets to see the worklog).  Also after too many pull requests add a line "Too much data to keep track of". Also change name of manager from Sarah Chen to just "Manager" also change the icon ot a plain "M" instead of SC

---

Make last scene in the video atleast 5 secodns longer (Not the whole scene just The screen which shows devlog at the end, for this you can increase time os scene but make sure this is filled up by only the last screen) Also make the Devlog Logo bigger, and add the github url: https://github.com/ishaan812/devlog somewhere too.

---

Also list the audio sounds you wnat and where you want me ot put them, with what names in md file pls to make this video great great great

<summary>Agent "Download ambient hum sound" completed</summary>
<result>The file has been successfully generated. From the ffmpeg output we can confirm the details:

- **File**: `/Users/ishaan812/Code/projects/devlog/video/public/sounds/ambient-hum.mp3`
- **Duration**: 8.00 seconds
- **Format**: MP3 (libmp3lame)
- **Bitrate**: ~192 kbps
- **Sample Rate**: 44100 Hz
- **File Size**: 194 KB

Here is a summary of what was created:

The ambient hum sound was generated using ffmpeg with a layered synthesis approach to create a dark, ominous, steady drone:

1. **55 Hz sine wave (volume 0.35)** - The primary deep bass drone (low A note), providing the core "hum" character
2. **30 Hz sine wave (volume 0.25)** - Sub-bass rumble for an ominous, heavy feel you sense more than hear
3. **110 Hz sine wave (volume 0.15)** - First harmonic overtone, adding body and warmth
4. **220 Hz sine wave (volume 0.05)** - Subtle higher harmonic for a slight buzzing texture
5. **Pink noise, low-pass filtered at 200 Hz (volume 0.20)** - Filtered noise for an "air/room" texture, like the sound of equipment fans or air conditioning

The combined signal is then:
- Mixed together without normalization to preserve the layered feel
- Faded in over 1.5 seconds at the start
- Faded out over 1.5 seconds at the end (starting at 6.5s)
- Low-pass filtered at 400 Hz to keep it dark and contained
- Boosted in volume by 2.5x for a healthy level

The result is a steady, slightly ominous low drone that sounds like a server room or dark ambient space -- exactly the kind of sound suitable for background atmosphere in a dev/tech video.</result>

**Downloaded and prepared:** `/Users/ishaan812/Code/projects/devlog/video/public/sounds/typing-soft.mp3`

**Source:** Mixkit free sound effects library -- sound effect #1386 from the keyboard/typing category ("Typing on a laptop keyboard" style). This is a royalty-free sound from [Mixkit's keyboard sound effects collection](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/keyboard/).

**Processing:**
1. Downloaded the full 26.36-second clip from `https://assets.mixkit.co/active_storage/sfx/1386/1386-preview.mp3`
2. Trimmed it to exactly **4 seconds** using ffmpeg
3. Applied a **1-second fade-out** starting at the 3-second mark for a smooth ending
4. Re-encoded at **128 kbps**, 44.1 kHz, stereo MP3

**Final file properties:**
- Format: MP3 (MPEG ADTS, Layer III, ID3 v2.4)
- Size: 65 KB
- Duration: 4 seconds
- Bitrate: 128 kbps
- Sample rate: 44.1 kHz, Stereo

The sound is a laptop keyboard typing effect -- laptop keyboards produce softer, quieter keystrokes compared to mechanical keyboards, which matches the "gentle, soft, not mechanical/clacky" requirement. The previous 8.3KB placeholder file has been replaced.</result>

**Downloaded:** A short swoosh/whoosh sound effect to `/Users/ishaan812/Code/projects/devlog/video/public/sounds/send-message.mp3`

**Source:** Mixkit.co free sound effects library - Swoosh sound #1487 from their royalty-free collection (`https://assets.mixkit.co/active_storage/sfx/1487/1487-preview.mp3`)

**File details:**

- **License:** Mixkit free sound effects are royalty-free for personal and commercial use

**Selection process:** I searched Mixkit's whoosh and swoosh categories and compared file sizes of ~20 candidates. Most whoosh sounds were 50-140KB (3-9 seconds), too long for a UI send-message sound. Sound #1487 from the swoosh category was the best fit at 12KB, producing a clean short swoosh approximately 0.74 seconds long -- ideal for a satisfying send-message interaction sound.</result>
