Instructions:
- Write a comprehensive weekly summary that synthesizes the daily progress into a cohesive narrative
- Organize the summary into key themes or areas of focus for the week
- Highlight major milestones, completed features, or significant progress made during the week
- Identify patterns in the work (e.g., "focused on authentication this week", "migrated from X to Y")
- Note any blockers, challenges overcome, or pivots in direction
- Include a brief forward-looking statement about what this week's work enables
- Use markdown with clear section headers (e.g., "### Key Accomplishments", "### Focus Areas")
- Keep it high-level and strategic - this is for tracking weekly progress, not daily minutiae
- Output 2-4 paragraphs with markdown formatting
- Use past tense active voice
