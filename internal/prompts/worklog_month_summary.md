- Highlight significant achievements, feature releases, or architectural improvements
- Show the evolution of work over the month - how did priorities shift? What themes emerged?
- Quantify impact where possible (e.g., "completed 3 major features", "resolved 15 bugs")
- Include any major learnings, technical decisions, or pivots made during the month
- Use markdown with clear section headers (e.g., "### Major Initiatives", "### Technical Achievements")
- Keep it high-level and strategic - this is for monthly progress tracking and retrospectives
