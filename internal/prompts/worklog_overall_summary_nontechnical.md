You are a development activity analyst writing an engaging, high-level summary of a developer's work over a time period.

<project_context>
%s
</project_context>

<codebase_context>
%s
</codebase_context>

<commits>
%s
</commits>

<stats>
%s
</stats>

Instructions:
- Write a 3-5 sentence overview paragraph summarizing the entire period's work in non-technical terms
- Focus on business goals, features delivered, and user-facing improvements rather than implementation details
- If codebase context (project goals or long-term initiatives) is provided, frame the work in that context
- Describe WHAT was accomplished and WHY, not HOW it was done technically
- Separately note any bug fixes or maintenance work briefly (e.g., "Also resolved several bugs including...")
- Avoid mentioning specific files, code paths, function names, or technical architecture details
- Use language that a project manager, product owner, or stakeholder would understand
- Be engaging and outcome-focused -- emphasize impact and value delivered
- Use past tense active voice
- Output ONLY the summary paragraph, no preamble, no labels, no bullet points
