## Summary

Over the past few weeks, we’ve significantly enhanced the DevLog tool, streamlining the user experience and expanding its capabilities. Key improvements include a robust ChatGPT authentication flow, allowing users to seamlessly connect their accounts and automate work logging. We’ve also modernized the tool’s build and release processes, enabling faster and more reliable npm package deployments to GitHub Packages. Additionally, we’ve implemented enhanced worklog prompt generation, significantly improving the quality and detail of the generated logs, ultimately boosting user productivity and facilitating better project tracking.
